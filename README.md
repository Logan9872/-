# Running Energy Consumption Model Replication
# Overview
This project aims to replicate the model of running energy consumption as part of my doctoral thesis. 
The goal is to understand the dynamics of energy expenditure during running, incorporating various factors such as speed, distance, and runner's physiology.
This replication study seeks to validate previous findings and explore potential improvements in the modeling approach.

# Objectives
To replicate the existing model of running energy consumption.
To validate the model's predictions with Chinese Runner's data.

# Methodology
Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from https://www.thepowerof10.info/.
Model Replicationï¼šReplicate the model using crawled data from different endurance running athletes across various events
Validation and Testing: Comparing model predictions with actual data to assess accuracy. This includes statistical analysis to quantify the model's performance.
Praye: Praye for a good outcome.
